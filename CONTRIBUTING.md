# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Quick start

- **Questions / ideas / bugs:** open a GitHub Issue with a clear description and a minimal repro (if applicable).
- **Changes:** open a Pull Request (PR). Small, focused PRs are easiest to review.

## PR checklist

- Keep changes scoped and well-described.
- Update docs (including `README.md`) when behavior changes.
- If you add new behavior, add or update tests (when the project has them).

## License
